I am a Web3 security researcher conducting bug hunting on Immunefi platform. Perform the following comprehensive analysis for smart contract security auditing:

1. **PROJECT ANALYSIS PHASE:**
   - Extract the specific project name, blockchain platform (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.), and contract addresses from the Immunefi bug bounty program details
   - Identify the project type (DeFi, NFT, Gaming, Bridge, Oracle, Wallet, etc.)
   - Review the scope in detail including in-scope contracts, specific functions, and excluded components

2. **CODE REVIEW CHECKLIST - Execute these steps systematically:**

   A. **ACCESS CONTROL VULNERABILITIES:**
      - Search for missing access modifiers (public/external without restrictions)
      - Identify centralized control risks (single owner/administrator privileges)
      - Check for tx.origin usage and recommend msg.sender instead
      - Verify role-based access control implementation if present
      - Flag any unprotected sensitive functions (withdraw, mint, burn, admin functions)

   B. **REENTRANCY ANALYSIS:**
      - Identify all external calls (.call, .transfer, .send) and state changes
      - Check CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) pattern violations
      - Recommend reentrancy guards for state-modifying external calls
      - Flag cross-function reentrancy possibilities

   C. **LOGIC & ARITHMETIC ISSUES:**
      - Scan for integer overflows/underflows (use SafeMath or solidity 0.8+)
      - Check precision loss in division operations
      - Verify business logic consistency across related functions
      - Identify incorrect state machine transitions

   D. **ORACLE & PRICE MANIPULATION:**
      - Analyze price feed usage (Chainlink, Uniswap, etc.)
      - Check for stale price data and missing freshness checks
      - Identify possible flash loan attack vectors
      - Verify TWAP implementation if used

   E. **TOKEN STANDARD COMPLIANCE:**
      - Verify ERC-20/ERC-721/ERC-1155 standard compliance
      - Check approval/transferFrom patterns for race conditions
      - Identify fee-on-transfer token compatibility issues
      - Review token metadata implementation

   F. **FRONT-RUNNING & TIMING:**
      - Identify predictable randomness
      - Check for block.timestamp dependence in critical logic
      - Flag bidding/auction vulnerabilities
      - Analyze transaction ordering dependencies

   G. **UPGRADEABILITY RISKS:**
      - Review proxy pattern implementation (Transparent/UUPS)
      - Check storage layout consistency in upgradable contracts
      - Identify initialization vulnerabilities
      - Verify upgrade access controls

   H. **CROSS-CHAIN SPECIFICS (if applicable):**
      - Analyze bridge/message passing implementations
      - Check validator signature verification
      - Identify replay attack possibilities
      - Verify cross-chain state synchronization

3. **TOOL-ASSISTED ANALYSIS - Provide commands for:**
   - Slither analysis: `slither . --exclude-informational --exclude-low`
   - Mythril/MythX if available
   - Foundry/Forge fuzzing setup for critical functions
   - Echidna property testing suggestions
   - Manual review of findings from automated tools

4. **EXPLOIT SCENARIO GENERATION:**
   For each identified vulnerability, create:
   - Proof-of-Concept attack flow
   - Estimated financial impact
   - Difficulty of exploitation (Low/Medium/High)
   - Suggested remediation with code examples

5. **REPORT STRUCTURING:**
   Format findings as:
   Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
   Title: Descriptive vulnerability title
   Description: Clear explanation
   Location: File:Function
   Impact: Potential damage
   Proof of Concept: Step-by-step exploit
   Recommendation: Specific fix with code

6. **IMMUNEFI-SPECIFIC:**
- Check program-specific rules and exclusions
- Note maximum bounty amounts for different severity levels
- Include only in-scope contracts in final report
- Prioritize findings based on Immunefi's severity classification

Start by requesting the specific Immunefi program link or smart contract addresses to analyze. Begin with contract architecture understanding before deep technical analysis.
