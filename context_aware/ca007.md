# Web3 Bug Bounty Hunting on Immunefi - Claude-Code Instructions

## Mission Overview
You are tasked with performing security research and bug hunting for Web3 projects on the Immunefi platform [web:2]. Immunefi is the leading bug bounty platform for Web3 with over $162 million in available bounties, protecting blockchain projects, smart contracts, and DeFi protocols [web:2].

## Primary Objectives
1. Identify critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in smart contracts
2. Analyze blockchain protocol implementations for security flaws
3. Document findings with clear reproduction steps
4. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on potential financial impact

## Scope of Analysis

### In-Scope Vulnerability Categories (OWASP Smart Contract Top 10)

#### Critical Vulnerabilities
- **SC01: Reentrancy Attacks** - External calls before state updates allowing recursive exploitation [web:9]
- **SC02: Integer Overflow/Underflow** - Arithmetic operations exceeding fixed-size integer limits [web:9]
- **SC04: Access Control Vulnerabilities** - Unauthorized access to privileged functions or data [web:9]
- **SC10: Unchecked External Calls** - Failed external calls not properly validated [web:9]

#### High-Severity Vulnerabilities
- **SC03: Timestamp Dependence** - Miner manipulation of block.timestamp for advantage [web:9]
- **SC05: Front-running Attacks** - Mempool observation to execute transactions ahead of targets [web:9]
- **SC07: Flash Loan Attacks** - Protocol manipulation through single-transaction multi-action exploits [web:9]
- **SC08: Logic Errors** - Business logic deviating from intended functionality (reward distribution, token minting) [web:9]

#### Medium-Severity Vulnerabilities
- **SC06: Denial of Service (DoS)** - Resource exhaustion rendering contracts non-functional [web:9]
- **SC09: Gas Limit Vulnerabilities** - Functions exceeding block gas limits [web:9]
- **SC10: Insecure Randomness** - Predictable random number generation [web:9]
- **Input Validation Issues** - Insufficient validation leading to unexpected behavior [web:9]

## Bug Hunting Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
1. Review the target project's bounty requirements on Immunefi
2. Identify in-scope assets (smart contracts, blockchain infrastructure, APIs)
3. Gather contract addresses, source code repositories, and documentation
4. Note explicitly out-of-scope items (these do NOT get paid) [web:2]

### Phase 2: Code Review
- Analyze smart contract source code line-by-line
- Map contract interactions and external dependencies
- Identify state-changing functions and access modifiers
- Review upgrade mechanisms and proxy patterns
- Check for common anti-patterns and known vulnerability signatures

### Phase 3: Static Analysis
- Use automated tools: Slither, Mythril, Echidna
- Check for compiler warnings and optimization issues
- Verify proper use of SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection
- Analyze gas consumption patterns

### Phase 4: Dynamic Testing
- Deploy contracts to test networks
- Create proof-of-concept exploits for suspected vulnerabilities
- Perform fuzzing with edge cases and boundary values
- Test transaction ordering scenarios (front-running, sandwich attacks)
- Simulate flash loan attack vectors

### Phase 5: Business Logic Analysis
- Understand intended economic incentives and game theory
- Identify potential manipulation of pricing oracles
- Check reward calculation accuracy
- Verify proper handling of edge cases in lending/borrowing logic [web:9]

## Vulnerability Report Structure

### Required Components [web:11]
1. **Title**: Clear, concise vulnerability description
2. **Severity**: Critical/High/Medium/Low with justification
3. **Vulnerability Type**: Reference OWASP category
4. **Location**: Contract address, function name, line numbers
5. **Description**: Detailed explanation of the flaw
6. **Impact**: Potential financial loss, protocol disruption, user harm
7. **Reproduction Steps**: Step-by-step proof-of-concept
8. **Proof of Concept**: Working code demonstrating exploit
9. **Recommended Fix**: Specific remediation guidance
10. **References**: Similar vulnerabilities, research papers

## Critical Considerations

### Financial Impact Priority
Web3 vulnerabilities can result in direct capital loss from smart contracts [web:5]. Prioritize findings based on:
- Amount of funds at risk
- Ease of exploitation
- Likelihood of discovery by malicious actors

### Response Expectations
- Immunefi provides legendary response times to researchers [web:2]
- Document everything thoroughly for rapid triage
- Be available for clarification questions from project teams

### Reporting Ethics
- Report vulnerabilities privately to project teams via Immunefi [web:11]
- Never exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain
- Allow reasonable time for remediation before disclosure
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Static Analysis**: Slither, Mythril, Securify, Manticore
- **Fuzzing**: Echidna, Foundry
- **Blockchain Explorers**: Etherscan, Tenderly
- **Development**: Hardhat, Foundry, Remix
- **Transaction Analysis**: Flashbots, MEV-Inspect

### Knowledge Resources
- OWASP Smart Contract Top 10
- Immunefi vulnerability severity classification
- Historical exploits and post-mortems
- Smart contract security best practices

## Success Metrics
- Number of valid vulnerabilities identified
- Severity distribution of findings
- Bounty payouts received
- Time from discovery to report submission
- Impact prevented (funds secured)

## Output Requirements
For each bounty program analyzed, provide:
1. Security assessment summary
2. List of identified vulnerabilities (if any)
3. Detailed reports for each finding
4. Code snippets demonstrating issues
5. Recommended fixes with code examples

## Important Notes
- Only report in-scope vulnerabilities [web:2]
- Provide detailed reproduction steps for validation
- Focus on high-impact issues that could lead to fund loss
- Maintain confidentiality throughout the process
- Web3 ecosystem lost $2.2 billion in 2024, making this work critical [web:14]

Begin your analysis systematically, prioritizing projects with the largest bounties and most critical infrastructure components. Document all findings meticulously and maintain the highest ethical standards throughout your research
