# Gadget
Frida’s Gadget is a shared library meant to be loaded by programs to be instrumented when the [Injected](https://frida.re/docs/modes/#injected) mode of operation isn’t suitable.
This may be done in a variety of ways, for example:
  * Modifying the source code of the program
  * Patching it or one of its libraries, e.g. by using a tool like [insert_dylib](https://github.com/Tyilo/insert_dylib)
  * Using a dynamic linker feature like _LD_PRELOAD_ or _DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES_


Gadget gets kickstarted as soon as the dynamic linker executes its constructor function.
It supports four different interactions depending on your use-case, where the [Listen](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#listen) interaction is the default. You can override this by adding a configuration file. The file should be named exactly like the Gadget binary but with _.config_ as its file extension. So for example if you named the binary _FridaGadget.dylib_ you would name the config file _FridaGadget.config_.
Note that you can name the Gadget binary whatever you want, which is useful for dodging anti-Frida detection schemes that look for a loaded library with “Frida” in its name.
It’s also worth noting that when using Xcode to add a .config to an iOS app, you might find that it’s inclined to put _FridaGadget.dylib_ in a subdirectory named “Frameworks”, and the “.config” in the directory above it – next to the app’s executable and any resource files. Because of this, Gadget will also look for the .config in the parent directory in this case. But only if it’s put in a directory named “Frameworks”.
On Android, the package manager will only copy files from a non-debuggable application’s `/lib` directory if their name matches the following conditions:
  * It starts with the prefix `lib`
  * It ends with the suffix `.so`
  * It’s `gdbserver`


Frida is well aware of this limitation and will accept a config file with those changes. Example:
```
lib
└── arm64-v8a
    ├── libgadget.config.so
    ├── libgadget.so

```

For more information, please check [this article](https://lief.quarkslab.com/doc/latest/tutorials/09_frida_lief.html#id9).
The config file should be a UTF-8 encoded text file with a JSON object as its root. It supports four different keys at the root level:
  * `interaction`: object describing which interaction to use. It defaults to the [Listen](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#listen) interaction.
  * `teardown`: string specifying either `minimal` or `full`, stating how much cleanup to perform when the library gets unloaded. The default is `minimal`, which means we don’t shut down internal threads and free allocated memory and OS resources. This is fine if Gadget’s lifetime is linked to the program itself. Specify `full` if you intend to unload it at some point.
  * `runtime`: string specifying either `default`, `qjs`, or `v8`, letting you override the default JavaScript runtime used.
  * `code_signing`: string specifying either `optional` or `required`, making it possible to run on a jailed iOS device without a debugger attached by setting this to `required`. The default is `optional`, which means Frida will assume that it is possible to modify existing code in memory and run unsigned code, both without getting killed by the kernel. Setting this to `required` also means the Interceptor API is unavailable. So on a jailed iOS device the only way to use the Interceptor API is if a debugger is attached prior to Gadget being loaded. Note that it is sufficient to just launch the app with a debugger, it does not have to remain attached as the relaxed code-signing state is sticky once set.


## Supported interaction types
  1. [Listen](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#listen)
  2. [Connect](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#connect)
  3. [Script](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#script)
  4. [ScriptDirectory](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#scriptdirectory)


## Listen
This is the default interaction, where Gadget exposes a _frida-server_ compatible interface, listening on _localhost:27042_ by default. The only difference is that the lists of running processes and installed apps only contain a single entry, which is for the program itself. The process name is always just _Gadget_ , and the installed app’s identifier is always _re.frida.Gadget_.
In order to achieve early instrumentation we let Gadget’s constructor function block until you either _attach()_ to the process, or call _resume()_ after going through the usual _spawn()_ -> _attach()_ -> _…apply instrumentation…_ steps. This means that existing CLI tools like [frida-trace](https://frida.re/docs/frida-trace/) work the same ways you’re already using them.
If you don’t want this blocking behavior and want to let the program boot right up, or you’d prefer it listening on a different interface or port, you can customize this through the configuration file.
The default configuration is:
```
{
  "interaction": {
    "type": "listen",
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 27042,
    "on_port_conflict": "fail",
    "on_load": "wait"
  }
}
```

Supported configuration keys are:
  * `address`: string specifying the interface to listen on. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`. Specify `0.0.0.0` to listen on all IPv4 interfaces, `::` to listen on all IPv6 interfaces.
  * `port`: number specifying the TCP port to listen on. Defaults to `27042`.
  * `certificate`: specify this to enable TLS. Must be a PEM-encoded public and private key, either as a string containing the multi-line PEM data, or a single-line string specifying the filesystem path to load it from. The server will accept any certificate from the client’s side.
  * `token`: specify this to enable authentication. Must be a string specifying the secret token expected from incoming clients.
  * `on_port_conflict`: string specifying either `fail` or `pick-next`, stating what to do if the listening port is already taken. The default is `fail`, which means Gadget will fail to start. Specify `pick-next` if you would like it to try each consecutive port until an available port is found.
  * `on_load`: string specifying either `resume` or `wait`, stating what to do when Gadget is loaded. The default is `wait`, which means it will wait for you to connect to it and tell it to resume. Specify `resume` if you would like the program to be allowed to start immediately, which is useful if you just want to be able to attach at a later time.
  * `origin`: specify this to protect against unauthorized cross-origin use from from web browsers, by requiring that the “Origin” header matches the value specified here.
  * `asset_root`: specify this to serve static files over HTTP/HTTPS, where any accessible files inside the specified directory are exposed. By default no files are served.


## Connect
This is the inverse of the “Listen” interaction, where instead of listening on TCP, Gadget will connect to a running _frida-portal_ and become a node in its cluster of processes. This is the so-called _cluster_ interface that it listens on. The Portal typically also exposes a _control_ interface, which speaks the same protocol as _frida-server_. This allows any connected controllers to _enumerate_processes()_ and _attach()_ to them as if they were local to the machine where the Portal is running.
In order to achieve early instrumentation we let Gadget’s constructor function block until _resume()_ is requested by a controller – but only if spawn-gating is enabled. (Through _Device.enable_spawn_gating()_.) This means that for a simple setup, Gadget will only block until it’s connected to the Portal and has joined its cluster – in order to ask it whether spawn-gating is enabled.
The default configuration is:
```
{
  "interaction": {
    "type": "connect",
    "address": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 27052
  }
}
```

Supported configuration keys are:
  * `address`: string specifying the host to connect to, which is where the Portal’s cluster interface is exposed. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
  * `port`: number specifying the TCP port to connect to, on the host where the Portal’s cluster interface is exposed. Defaults to `27052`.
  * `certificate`: must be specified if the Portal has TLS enabled. Contains a PEM-encoded public key, either as a string containing the multi-line PEM data, or a single-line string specifying the filesystem path to load it from. This is the public key of a trusted CA, which the server’s certificate must match or be derived from.
  * `token`: must be specified if the Portal’s cluster interface has authentication enabled. This is a string specifying the token to present to the Portal. The actual interpretation of this string depends on the Portal implementation, and ranges from a fixed secret in case of _frida-portal_ , to anything (such as an OAuth access token) in case the Portal is instantiated through the API with a custom authentication service plugged into it.
  * `acl`: array of strings that specify an Access Control List, used to limit which controllers are able to discover and interact with this process. For example in case of `["team-a", "team-b"]`, any controller from “team-a” or “team-b” will be granted access. This key should only be set if the Portal is instantiated through the API, as custom application code is required to _tag_ the controller connections to be granted access, typically based on some custom authentication scheme.


##### Advanced users
For greater control, such as custom authentication, per-node ACLs, and application-specific protocol messages, you may also instantiate the PortalService object instead of running the frida-portal CLI program. 
## Script
Sometimes it is useful to apply some instrumentation in a fully autonomous manner, by just loading a script from the filesystem before the program’s entrypoint is executed.
Here’s the minimal configuration needed:
```
{
  "interaction": {
    "type": "script",
    "path": "/home/oleavr/explore.js"
  }
}
```

Where _explore.js_ contains the following skeleton:
```
rpc.exports = {
  init(stage, parameters) {
    console.log('[init]', stage, JSON.stringify(parameters));

    Interceptor.attach(Module.getGlobalExportByName('open'), {
      onEnter(args) {
        const path = args[0].readUtf8String();
        console.log('open("' + path + '")');
      }
    });
  },
  dispose() {
    console.log('[dispose]');
  }
};
```

The [rpc.exports](https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#rpc) part is actually optional, and is useful when your script needs to be aware of its lifecycle.
Gadget calls your `init()` method and waits for it to return before letting the program execute its entrypoint. This means you can return a _Promise_ if you need to do something asynchronous, e.g. [Socket.connect()](https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#socket), and guarantees that you won’t miss any early calls. The first argument, `stage`, is a string specifying either `early` or `late`, useful for knowing if Gadget was just loaded, or the script is being reloaded. More on the latter topic below. The second argument, `parameters`, is the object optionally specified in the configuration file, or an empty object if not. This is useful for parameterising your scripts.
You may also expose a `dispose()` method if you need to perform some explicit cleanup when the script is unloaded. This typically happens because the process exits, the Gadget is unloaded, or your script get unloaded before a new version is loaded from disk.
For debugging you can use _console.log()_ , _console.warn()_ , and _console.error()_ , which will print to _stdout_ /_stderr_.
Supported configuration keys are:
  * `path`: string specifying the filesystem path to the script to load. May also be a path relative to where the Gadget binary resides. Specifying a relative path on iOS will first look for the script relative to the app’s Documents directory. This means you can use iTunes file sharing to upload an updated version of the script, or update it by vending the whole container through AFC, which is allowed for debuggable apps. This is especially useful together with `"on_change": "reload"`. This key does not have a default value and must be provided.
  * `parameters`: object containing arbitrary configuration data that you would like to pass to the `init()` RPC method. Defaults to an empty object.
  * `on_change`: string specifying either `ignore` or `reload`, where `ignore` means the script will be loaded exactly once, and `reload` means Gadget will monitor the file and reload the script anytime it changes. The default is `ignore`, but `reload` is highly recommended during development.


## ScriptDirectory
In some cases you may want to tamper with system-wide programs and libraries, but instead of identifying the program from your script’s logic, you might want to do some minimal filtering and load different scripts based on the program that Gadget is running inside. You may not even need any filtering, but find it convenient to treat each script as a separate plugin. On a GNU/Linux system such scripts could even be provided by packages, making it easy to install tweaks for existing applications.
Here’s the minimal configuration needed:
```
{
  "interaction": {
    "type": "script-directory",
    "path": "/usr/local/frida/scripts"
  }
}
```

Supported configuration keys are:
  * `path`: string specifying the filesystem path to the directory containing scripts to load. May also be a path relative to where the Gadget binary resides. This key does not have a default value and must be provided. Scripts should use _.js_ as their file extension, and each script may also have configuration data in a _.config_ file next to it. This means that _twitter.js_ may specify its configuration in a file named _twitter.config_.
  * `on_change`: string specifying either `ignore` or `rescan`, where `ignore` means the directory will be scanned exactly once, and `rescan` means Gadget will monitor the directory and rescan it anytime it changes. The default is `ignore`, but `rescan` is highly recommended during development.


Each script’s optional configuration file may contain the following keys:
  * `filter`: object containing criteria for this script to be loaded. Only one of them has to match, so complex filtering should be implemented in the script itself if needed. Supports the following keys specifying what to match:
    * `executables`: array of strings specifying executable names
    * `bundles`: array of strings specifying bundle identifiers
    * `objc_classes`: array of strings specifying Objective-C class names
  * `parameters`: object containing arbitrary configuration data that you would like to pass to the `init()` RPC method. Defaults to an empty object.
  * `on_change`: string specifying either `ignore` or `reload`, where `ignore` means the script will be loaded exactly once, and `reload` means Gadget will monitor the file and reload the script anytime it changes. The default is `ignore`, but `reload` is highly recommended during development.


Say you want to write a tweak for Twitter’s macOS app, you could create a file named _twitter.js_ in _/usr/local/frida/scripts_ , containing:
```
const { TMTheme } = ObjC.classes;

rpc.exports = {
  init(stage, parameters) {
    console.log('[init]', stage, JSON.stringify(parameters));

    ObjC.schedule(ObjC.mainQueue, () => {
      TMTheme.switchToTheme_(TMTheme.darkTheme());
    });
  },
  dispose() {
    console.log('[dispose]');

    ObjC.schedule(ObjC.mainQueue, () => {
      TMTheme.switchToTheme_(TMTheme.lightTheme());
    });
  }
};
```

Then, to make sure this script is only loaded into that specific app, you would create another file named _twitter.config_ , containing:
```
{
  "filter": {
    "executables": ["Twitter"],
    "bundles": ["com.twitter.twitter-mac"],
    "objc_classes": ["Twitter"]
  }
}
```

This example is saying that we would like the script to be loaded if either:
  * The executable name is `Twitter`, or
  * its bundle identifier is `com.twitter.twitter-mac`, or
  * it’s got an Objective-C class loaded whose name is `Twitter`.


For this particular example you would probably only filter on the bundle ID, as that’s the most stable identifier, and if needed, do compatibility checks in code.
Next to the `filter` key you may also specify `parameters` and `on_change`, just like in the [Script](https://frida.re/docs/gadget/#script) configuration above.
