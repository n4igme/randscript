# Bug Bounty Skills

A structured 5-step workflow for AI-assisted security assessments of codebases, covering traditional web/API, Web3/smart contracts, and infrastructure.

## Workflow

```
sc1-recon → sc2-threat-model → sc3-vuln-scan → sc4-validate → sc5-report
```

| Step | Skill | What it does | Output |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `sc1-recon` | Map codebase structure, entry points, data flows | `assessment/recon.md` |
| 2 | `sc2-threat-model` | STRIDE analysis, attack trees, priority targets | `assessment/threat-model.md` |
| 3 | `sc3-vuln-scan` | Orchestrate 33 focused vulnerability scanners | `assessment/vulnerabilities.md` |
| 4 | `sc4-validate` | Re-read code, trace data flows, eliminate false positives | `assessment/validated-vulnerabilities.md` |
| 5 | `sc5-report` | Professional report with CVSS, remediation, roadmap | `assessment/bug-bounty-report.md` |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Quick 30-min triage (decides if full assessment is needed)
/skill sc0-quick-review

# Full assessment (run in target repo directory)
/skill sc1-recon
/skill sc2-threat-model
/skill sc3-vuln-scan    # orchestrates all relevant sub-scanners
/skill sc4-validate
/skill sc5-report

# Or target a specific scanner
/skill vuln-injection
/skill vuln-web3-reentrancy
```

## Scanner Categories

Shared Foundry PoC templates: `web3-poc-templates`

### Systems & Infrastructure (3x-a–3x-c)

| Skill | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `vuln-dos` | ReDoS, algorithmic complexity, resource exhaustion |
| `vuln-memory` | Buffer overflow, use-after-free (C/C++/Rust) |
| `vuln-infra` | Terraform, Docker, K8s, CI/CD, Helm |

### Platform-Specific (3p-a–3p-e)

| Skill | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| `vuln-nodejs` | path.join traversal, Zip Slip, require RCE, prototype pollution |
| `vuln-spring-boot` | Actuator, @PreAuthorize gaps, SpEL injection, mass assignment |
| `vuln-custom-crypto` | Insecure PRNG, homegrown hashing, hardcoded keys, timing |
| `vuln-mobile-code` | Android/iOS secrets, insecure storage, WebView, cert pinning |
| `vuln-deployment-security` | Istio AuthorizationPolicy, mTLS, NetworkPolicy, Helm |

## Key Features

- **Auto-skip**: Scanners detect when they're not applicable and skip gracefully
- **Idempotent**: Re-running a scanner replaces its section (no duplicates)
- **Deduplication**: Cross-scanner overlap is detected and noted
- **Positive observations**: Each scanner notes what the codebase does well
- **Platform-aware**: sc5-report maps severity to Immunefi/HackerOne/Bugcrowd/Code4rena
- **Parallelizable**: Independent scanners can run simultaneously (see sc3 parallelism guide)

## Output Structure

All outputs go to `./assessment/` in the target repository:

```
